# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure

PoliLink is a Laravel API and React SPA for publishing and discovering ESPOL
community events. Backend source is in `backend/app/`, routes in
`backend/routes/`, database migrations and seeders in `backend/database/`, and
PHPUnit feature tests in `backend/tests/`. Frontend source is in
`frontend/src/`; static assets are in `frontend/public/`. Technical docs and
the proposal are under `docs/`, especially `docs/CONTEXT/`, `docs/api/`, and
`docs/latex/`.

The backend currently implements local Sanctum authentication, communities,
event catalog/filtering, event management, and registrations. The React UI is
still a starter screen with partial API helpers, so do not describe frontend
flows as complete unless they are actually wired and checked.

## Development Commands

Humans manage Docker, MySQL, Laravel, and Vite processes. From the repository
root, start only MySQL with `docker compose up -d mysql`. In `backend/`, use
`composer install`, `php artisan migrate`, and `php artisan serve`. In
`frontend/`, use `npm install` and `npm run dev`. Available checks are
`php artisan test`, `vendor/bin/pint --test`, `npm run lint`, and
`npm run build`. Agents must run tests, builds, or validation only when the
task explicitly requests them.

## Code Style and Testing

Use four-space indentation in PHP and two spaces in TypeScript. Follow Laravel
conventions: PascalCase classes, camelCase methods, Form Requests for input
validation, Policies for authorization, and timestamped migration names.
React components use PascalCase; helpers and variables use camelCase.
Name PHPUnit methods `test_<behavior>`. Add feature coverage for changed API
rules and authorization paths; no formal frontend coverage threshold is set.

## Language and URL Conventions

Keep source-code identifiers, filenames, comments, and API client methods in
English. Write user-facing labels, messages, documentation examples shown to
users, and browser routes in Spanish. For example, use `/eventos` and
`/iniciar-sesion` for frontend navigation while keeping names such as
`EventCatalogPage`, `useAuth`, and `eventDetail` in English. Backend API paths
such as `/api/auth/login` and `/api/events` remain unchanged because they are
part of the existing contract.

## Scope, Security, and Documentation

Organizers publish, edit, and cancel events directly; students register and
cancel registrations. Do not add approval workflows, institutional
integrations, payments, email/calendar integration, QR codes, or attendance
validation without approval. Keep credentials in `.env`, never commit them,
and use `backend/.env.example` as the template. Use `127.0.0.1` for host
Laravel-to-MySQL connections; `mysql` is only a container hostname.

Keep `docs/api/API.md`, the approved context, README files, and the LaTeX
proposal consistent. Mark planned behavior as planned.

## Commits and Pull Requests

Use concise conventional-style messages such as `feat: add event filters` or
`docs: update API guide`. PRs should explain the scope, list checks actually
run, identify known limitations, and include UI or proposal screenshots when
relevant. Preserve unrelated working-tree changes.
